	 * This matrix class creates points to a portion of a vector, presenting it as a matrix. Matrix operations can then be perfomed, possibly modifying the data pointed to.

	 * The matrix is column-major to comply with LAPACK and BLAS routines.
	 * Columns and rows are base-0. Range checking is done unless the flag -DLMRG_CHECK_OFF is set at compile time.
	 * Methods that support missing data assume that missing values are coded with `nan("")`.
